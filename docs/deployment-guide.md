# Deployment Guide for Job OS

This guide covers multiple deployment options for Job OS, from simple static hosting to more advanced cloud platforms.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
1. A Firebase project set up with:
   - Authentication (Anonymous sign-in enabled)
   - Firestore Database
   - Cloud Storage
2. Your Firebase configuration updated in `index.html`

## Deployment Options

### 1. Netlify (Recommended)

**Easy drag-and-drop deployment:**

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up/login to your account
3. Drag your entire Job_OS folder to the deployment area
4. Your site will be live instantly with a random URL
5. Optional: Set up a custom domain

**Advanced Netlify deployment:**

1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Copy `deployment/netlify.toml` to your project root
3. Push to GitHub
4. Netlify will auto-deploy on every push

### 2. Vercel

**GitHub integration:**

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up/login and connect your GitHub account
3. Import your Job OS repository
4. Copy `deployment/vercel.json` to project root
5. Deploy automatically

**Manual deployment:**

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run `vercel` in your project directory
3. Follow the prompts

### 3. GitHub Pages

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Upload all your files
3. Go to Settings > Pages
4. Select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose your main branch
6. Your app will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/job-os`

### 4. Firebase Hosting

Since you're already using Firebase for the backend:

1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Run `firebase login`
3. Run `firebase init hosting` in your project directory
4. Select your Firebase project
5. Set public directory to current directory (`.`)
6. Configure as single-page app: Yes
7. Run `firebase deploy`

### 5. Traditional Web Hosting

For shared hosting providers (like cPanel):

1. Upload all files to your domain's public folder
2. Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
3. Your app will be accessible at your domain

### 6. Local Development Server

For testing before deployment:

**Using Python (built-in):**
```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

**Using Node.js:**
```bash
npx serve .
```

**Using PHP (if MAMP/XAMPP is installed):**
- Place files in htdocs folder
- Access via `http://localhost/Job_OS`
